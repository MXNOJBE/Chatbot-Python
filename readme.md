This is Team Support_Bot, and this is a project on Forest Chatbot utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natual Langauge Processing(NLP), Deep Learning (DL), on Intel oneAPI server using Intel oneDNN.ðŸ‘¨

## ðŸ‘¯ Project Overview

This project aims The chatbot will be trained to provide companionship for users and
to provide an emotional support. The chatbot will be able to connect with individuals and provide necessary solutions and support

## âš¡ Motivation Behind our Project
